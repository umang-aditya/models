i have made a gui application in which we can give the folder which contains images.
we can also go through the images in the given folder and choose one of them for object detection.
we can choose which model to apply(frozen graphs)
in my application i have used 4 models
these are:
	1.faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28
	2.ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17
	3.ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2018_01_28
	4.ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_shared_box_predictor_640x640_coco14_sync_2018_07_03
we can also choose the detection threshold
and lastly we can use these parameters to detect object in the selected image
