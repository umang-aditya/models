This a gui application which is used for Auto labeling images.
In this application we can select the Folder Destiantion which contains image, model which we want to apply as well as the object detection threshold.
in my application i have used 4 models
these are:
	1.faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28
	2.ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17
	3.ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2018_01_28
	4.ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_shared_box_predictor_640x640_coco14_sync_2018_07_03
These 4 model can be found on tensorflow model Zoo

To run the application just run the application.ipynb
